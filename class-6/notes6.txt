FOR 1. 
Execution Flow
The program first assigns the value "Wednesday" to the variable ClassDay.
Then, it evaluates the condition in the if statement.
Since ClassDay is "Wednesday", the condition ClassDay === "Wednesday" is true.
Therefore, it executes the if block and prints: Go to class.
The else block is skipped because the if condition was true.

FOR 2.
Summary:
The first condition checks if homeFood is "DaalChawal" and moneyIHave is 300. If both conditions are true, it prints "Go out and buy biryani".
If the first condition is false, it checks if moneyIHave is greater than or equal to zingerPrice. If this condition is true, it prints "Buy zinger".
If none of the conditions are met, it prints "Eat DaalChawal".


FOR 3. SAME AS 4 BUT IT NUMBER WHILE 4 IS STRING

FOR 4.
The provided code uses a switch statement to execute different blocks of code based on the value of the foodItem variable. Let's break down how it works.
Variable Declaration:
This line declares a variable foodItem and assigns it the string value "pizza".

Switch Statement:
The switch statement evaluates the value of foodItem.

Case Statements:
The switch statement has multiple case clauses, each representing a potential value for foodItem.

Summary:
The switch statement evaluates the value of foodItem.
It compares the value of foodItem against each case.
When it finds a matching case, it executes the corresponding code block and then exits the switch statement using break.
If no matching case is found, none of the code blocks are executed.


FOR 5.
The code provided demonstrates the use of logical operators (&& for logical AND and || for logical OR) in TypeScript. Let's break down the code and explain how it works.
Variable Declarations:
These lines declare two boolean variables:
isMyBirthday: Indicates if it is your birthday (set to true).
amIHappy: Indicates if you are happy (set to false).

Logical AND Check:
The && operator returns true only if both operands are true.
In this case, isMyBirthday is true and amIHappy is false.
Since both conditions must be true for the if statement to execute, this block will not execute because amIHappy is false.

Logical OR Check:
The || operator returns true if at least one of the operands is true.
Here, isMyBirthday is true and amIHappy is false.
Since at least one condition is true, the if statement will execute and print: Happy birthday but i am not happy.
